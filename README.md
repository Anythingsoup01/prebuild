# prebuild
My own custom build generator, inspired by premake5

To compile -
  Clone / Download the repository
  Create 'build' folder in the root folder
  Run cmake .. followed by cmake --build .
  The prebuild executable will be located in the build folder

To use -
  Copy prebuild binary to the root of your project folder
  run the command prebuild [system] [version]

Supported systems -
  cmake (you can put any version as far as I'm aware if any errors occur open an Issue and it will be resolved as soon as possible)

Syntax - 
  Locate the docs folder for examples
